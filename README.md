A comparison of two AutoML libraries (FLAML and H2O) and 2 models, RF and XGBoost, "out-of-the-box" without any parameter or data processing was conducted on the Kaggle Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing dataset. 

Both AutoML libraries showed better results compared to the "out-of-the-box" models. The comparison was based on the MSE and R2 Score metrics.
